				The cloud computing is a booming market but it's hard to compare the different existing offers and to make a choice. This project, initiated by the Myriads team of the IRISA, aims to facilitate the choice of the best cloud to run your applications on. To do so, Cloudbook will be a network between applications that will recover and exchange information about their usage on various clouds to produce a ranking of the best clouds for each application. The network will be decentralized which will ensure its sustainability. Each application will have "friends" applications, automatically selected according to their similarities with the application and which information will be most relevant to find the best cloud for this application, indeed the closer two applications are in terms of characteristics, the closer are their needs.
				</br>
				The implementation will be carried out by a peer-to-peer network of application controllers communicating via a protocol such as gossip. The application will be programmed ​​in java.
			</p>

				The group working on the project consists of five 4th year students from the INSA of Rennes : Abderrahmane AMALOU, Matthieu BERTIN, Sami EL ALAMI TREBKI, Gwendal LE MOULEC and Bruno MATRY. The project is overseen by Jean-Louis Pazat a member of the Myriads team, lecturer and researcher at the INSA of Rennes.
